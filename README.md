# HaggleBuddy
<p> (changed the name from HaggleMaster) </p>
An android wear and handheld app that helps our target users 1) become more familiar with haggling and bargaining for goods in foreign countries, with the aid of a friend who can support, encourage, and advise the user without doing the haggling for them, and 2) to protect target users from getting taken advantage of in a foreign place as well as making them more knowledgeable of what kind of prices to expect.
